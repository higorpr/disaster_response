## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
2. How the idea of having a good salary influences on a developerâ€™s satisfaction?
3. People who earn more money tend to give a higher value for job security?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist the understanding of the code. 

There is an additional `.py` file that was used as a scrap book for testing code.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://higorpr.medium.com/a-quick-look-into-the-relation-between-developers-and-money-e0c8cd29d862).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
